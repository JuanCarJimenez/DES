# DES Enciphering in Python

A simple Python implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm for educational and cybersecurity practice purposes.

## Description

This project provides a basic DES encryption tool written in Python. While not longer an standard, it helps demonstrates the fundamental operations of DES, including key scheduling, permutations and the Feistel function.
This is my first public cryptography-related project as I build my cybersecurity portfolio.

## Features

- Encrypt plaintext using DES algorithm
- Demonstrates key scheduling and block processing
